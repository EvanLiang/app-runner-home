The App Runner App Launcher
===========================

This is an optional web front end for [App Runner](https://github.com/danielflower/app-runner)

Running locally
---------------

This project uses the REST API exposed by 
[App Runner Router](https://github.com/danielflower/app-runner-router)
so clone the source code of that and run `RunLocal.java` which is in the router's test dir.

Once started, run `com.danielflower.apprunner.App.main` in this project.
