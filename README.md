The App Runner App Launcher
===========================

This is an optional web front end for [App Runner](https://github.com/danielflower/app-runner)

Running locally
---------------

This project uses the REST API exposed by [App Runner](https://github.com/danielflower/app-runner), 
so download that first and run `RunLocal.java`

Once started, run `com.danielflower.apprunner.App.main` in this project. It will call the REST service
on `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/apps`
